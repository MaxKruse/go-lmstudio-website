# Golang + LMStudio 

This project is a proof-of-concept (and learning exercise for myself) on how to write a webserver with regular functionality and then adding integration with LM Studio for real-time LLM interactions (including tool usage specific for the project itself).

An openapi spec will be provided using the tool [Swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag).
